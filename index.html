					<ol class="list-group list-group-flush list-group-numbered">
						<li class="list-group-item">The page looks outdated</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">The section navigation bar is poorly formatted</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">The picture for the main headline (the middle article) is not larger than the other pictures, meaning the page isn’t fully calling attention to the article</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">There’s no “about” or “join us” page</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">The page is meant to emulate a newspaper, but it looks crowded</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">On tablet and phone, the articles don’t reorder on the page. Instead, the text and photos become smaller, and the entire view compresses</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<p class="m-3">The accessibility test revealed that there were some photos <strong class="emphasis">missing alternative text</strong>, there was <b class="emphasis">no set language</b>, and there were some <b class="emphasis">missing form labels</b> as well. There were also <b class="emphasis">no page regions</b> found. The overall structure of the page was fairly clear, and the hierarchies were consistent from an accessibility standpoint. I would disagree that the hierarchies are as clear from a design standpoint as the main headline isn’t clearly highlighted. Additionally, when the display was the size of a phone, the <b class="emphasis">text was extremely small</b>, which may pose difficulties for users with low vision.

				<li class="list-group-item">How often do you order from Tigar Sugar using the kiosk?</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Do you prefer ordering with the kiosk or the cashier? Why?</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Do you have a regular boba order?</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">How would you rate the process of finding and customizing your order on this interface?</li>

				<li class="list-group-item">Were there any parts of the process that were inconvenient?</li>
			</ol>
      <h5 class="mt-2">Key findings:</h5>
      <p>
				I found that users of the Tiger Sugar ordering kiosk typically began the process in one of two ways: by scrolling through the homepage to
				the category of drink they wanted, or by searching for their specific drink. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Users who had a regular order at Tiger Sugar typically spent less time on the homepage
				and moved on to the ordering page more quickly, whereas new users who were unfamiliar with the ordering process took more time on the home page looking at drink options.
			</p>
			<p>
				Regular kiosk users were also more inclined to opt into the Tiger Sugar rewards program, and they believed it added value. The new users instead saw
				the rewards screen as not valuable. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Both new and returning users felt lke there were more steps than necessary. Returning users felt that there were more steps required to use
				the kiosk rather than simply asking ther cashier for their order, and they didn't having to enter their phone number in. New users thought the rewards
				screen was an unnecessary extra step.
			</p>
			<p>
				Returning users felt that the customizations offered on the customization page were not always consitent with their typical order, and that some of the customization options
				were contradictory or confusing. New users typically did not make as much use of the customization page (beyond allergen requirements) because they were less familiar with the drink they were ordering.

						the interface. He does appreciate the ability to collect reward points on the kiosk, which is not available at the cashier.
